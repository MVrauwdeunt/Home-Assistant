# Home-Assistant

My Home-Automation consists of Home-Assistant Core, an Mosquitto broker and ESPHome all running in a Docker container on a Debian server.
Besides above containers the server runs a bunch of other containers. To manage my audio and video media, a Unifi container to manage my network. Traefik for easy and secure access without remmembering the different ports.
