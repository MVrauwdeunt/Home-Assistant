# This is my current Home Assistant installation.
[![HA Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Home%20Assistant-2021.5.2-brightgreen)](https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant/releases/2021.5.2)

Home Assistant runs on a server which runs 38 docker containers. Some are related to my smarthome Home Assistant offcourse, ESPHome, Mosquitto, Deconz.
There are a couple of containers which work with Home Assistant but could be fun or usefull in other situations. For instance Grocy, Barcode Buddy, VSCode and Rhasspy.
Then there are several containers related to my multimedia setup. Automated download and handling of audio, video and subtitles and such. And last the containers for controlling, 
securing and backup of the server and network. Authelia, Duplicati and Unifi among others
