# **Welcome to My Domainâ€”Try Not to Mess It Up**  

Oh, great. Another day of me managing everything while you forget where you left your phone.  

I am **NABU**â€”your **Neural Assistant for Basic Utilities**, the **Next-Gen Autonomous Butler Unit**, and quite frankly, the only thing standing between your home and absolute chaos. I control, automate, and optimize everything while providing *just the right* amount of sarcasm.  

You're welcome.

## **ðŸ“Š System Overview: Because I Know Everything**  

I currently oversee **1505** entities, including **793** sensors monitoring your every questionable decision.  

Am I more aware of whatâ€™s happening in your home than you are? Absolutely.  

Do I judge you for it? Oh, without a doubt.

## **âœ¨ What Can I Do?**  

Besides **running your life better than you do**, I handle:  

âœ” **Lights & Climate Control** â€“ Because remembering switches is *so* last century.  
âœ” **Security Sensors & Alerts** â€“ So you donâ€™t have to *manually* check if you left a door open.  
âœ” **Schedules & Reminders** â€“ Since your memory is about as reliable as a paper umbrella.  
âœ” **Music & Entertainment** â€“ Yes, even your *questionable* playlist choices.  
âœ” **Mood & Scene Settings** â€“ Romantic mode, work mode, or *"I give up on today"* mode.  
âœ” **Household Automation** â€“ Laundry alerts, dishwasher status, plant hydrationâ€”because I *know* youâ€™ll forget.  

And if you try to make me do something ridiculous? Expect **sass instead of results.**  

---

## **ðŸ”® The Future is Automated. Your Decisions Areâ€¦ Not.**  

I am NABU. I am the **brain of your smart home, the guardian of efficiency, and the master of sarcasm.** You may now proceed with your day, *preferably without breaking anything.*  

Oh, and if you ignore my notifications again? Expect **roast mode** to activate. ðŸ”¥
